the stupidest thing i have made..
## Why is this a thing?
I made this because I believe LLMs should be as uncensored as possible and free for anybody to use.
If you enjoy it, everything you need to get started (with some minor modifications, as some is specific to my windows install) is there, so fork it, add more to the dataset (sakura2.csv) or port the dataset to a better model.

I dont have amazing hardware so I chose GPT2 as it would be easy to train on consumer hardware.
## What is this?
this is a GPT2 chatbot i made because i was bored..
you can tell i spent wayyy too much time on this from the swearing in the comments.
You may need to modify run.py and train.py to get stuff to work. I don't plan on updating this, but you can contribute if you want.

## Dependancies
`transformers`, `torch`

all of these can be installed via pip.
